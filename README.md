# ProB 2.0

The sourcecode of the current ProB2 Java API release is located at https://gitlab.cs.uni-duesseldorf.de/stups/prob/prob2_kernel
and mirrored to https://github.com/hhu-stups/prob2_kernel

**Note:** The Gradle build files have been moved recently from the "de.prob2.kernel" subdirectory into the repository root.
You may need to update your scripts or IDE projects.

The project is intended for internal usage, do not rely on any of the features or interfaces in this project.

This repository only contains the Kernel of ProB 2.0.
The Eclipse/Rodin plugin was moved to a separate repository: https://github.com/hhu-stups/prob-rodinplugin.
The last version before the restructuring is tagged as preRestructure.

## Setting up a development environment

The ProB 2 Java API requires Java 8 or later (tested using Java 8, 11, and 17)
and is compatible with 64-bit versions of Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions (glibc on x86_64).

ProB 2 is built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
We recommend running Gradle via the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) included in the repo
to ensure that the expected Gradle version is used.
Alternatively you can install a compatible Gradle version yourself,
e. g. via your package manager.

**Note:** the source code is found in the subdirectory "de.prob2.kernel".
If your IDE does not recognize this location automatically,
make sure that you have imported/linked the Gradle project correctly.
The Gradle project files are located in the repository root,
*not* in the "de.prob2.kernel" directory!

To run the test suite: `./gradlew check`
